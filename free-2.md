# Free project 2

## The user and a language

This section describes who the project would serve and why a language might be a
good way to meet their needs.

This would be a language that would allow people to track their health and generate stats based on the data they track. 

### What's the need?

_What need is met by your idea? Who are you helping? What is that person's
experience like now? What would their experience be like if you could help
them?_

People who want to better their health by tracking how many calories they lost and/or ate throughout the day as well as their weight. There are many apps that do this but they can be expensive and offer too many uneccessary features. 

### Why a language?

_Why is a DSL appropriate for your user(s)? How does it address the need?_

A language would allow users to quickly enter data, but also have the option to specify and generate a variety of graphs so they could notice trends in the data. 

### Why you?

_What excites you about this idea? How did you come up with it?_

I have been trying to lose weight and track this progress over the last couple months and I haven't been able to find an application that is actually helpful with this task. 

### Domain

_Describe the project's domain in five words._

Create graphs about health data

### Interface (syntax)

_How might the user interact with the language? What does programming look
like? Why is this the right way to interact with the problem domain?_

The user can how many calories they eat throughout the day as well as how many they lose, and can also enter their weight. They can then generate a dashboard showing trends over a specified period of time or create custom graphs themselves. 

### Operation (semantics)

_What might happen when a program runs? How does a program interact with the
user? What kinds of errors might occur, and how might they be communicated to
the user?_

The program will run by eaither saving the data they entered or by displaying the graph or dashboard. 

### Expressiveness

_What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but
difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?_

It should be easy to enter data and generate statistics. It should be difficult to enter data that are outliers or generate graphs that are meaningless. 

### Related work

_Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there
aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well
do they address the need? Are there any particularly admirable qualities of the
language? Are there parts of the language you think could be improved?_

There are various health tracking applications, but I have yet to find one that is both free and offers customizable statistics. I haven't found any DSLs on this topic either probably because there are already so many apps. It may seem like this topic already has a lot of resources but none of them are actually very helpful. 

## The Project

This section examines whether the idea makes for a good CS 111 project.

I think it will make a good project because health is an important matter that everyone can benefit from. 

### Suitability

_If someone were to work on this project, what percentage of their time would be
spent directly engaging in the **language** aspects of this project (e.g.,
making language design decisions), as opposed to "systems" aspects of the
project (e.g., implementing a complicated semantics that doesn't require a lot
of language design)?_

I think that 70% of the work would be spent on systems. I'd imagine that it would be difficult to design the generation of graphs. 

### Scope

_How big an idea is this? How ambitious is this project?_

I think that the data tracking part of this language would be possible, but generating statistic might be difficult depending on how customizable you want it to be. 

### Benefits and drawbacks

_Why might this be a good idea for a project? Why might this not be a good idea
project?_

This would be a good project because it would help many people with their health, however it may be difficult to find users for the language because tehre are already so many alternatives and the everyday person might not be interested in coding even if the language is simplified.
