# Free project 1

## The user and a language

This section describes who the project would serve and why a language might be a
good way to meet their needs.

This language would serve the general population to assist them in writing and organising journals for various purposes. 

### What's the need?

_What need is met by your idea? Who are you helping? What is that person's
experience like now? What would their experience be like if you could help
them?_

There are a lot of applications that are can be used for journaling or are specifically used for journaling, but a lot of them are expensive and/or have overcomplicated features. My language would just be used to organize text files for those who don't care about aesthetics and sre more concerned about accessibilty and organization. 

### Why a language?

_Why is a DSL appropriate for your user(s)? How does it address the need?_

A language would be ideal because if your are journaling then you are already sitting at a keyboard so you can be ready to type code. It is also faster and easier than clicking through a file system and opening files. 

### Why you?

_What excites you about this idea? How did you come up with it?_

I came up with this idea because I have yet to find any journaling applications that can automatically sort files, so you can both open and create new ones. Privacy is also important to me, so it is important that this can be used on the user's local computer. 

### Domain

_Describe the project's domain in five words._

Writing, storing and organizing journals

### Interface (syntax)

_How might the user interact with the language? What does programming look
like? Why is this the right way to interact with the problem domain?_

The user can type in a jornal entry and give it a category from within the application. This is the best way to do it so they don't have to create a text file themselves. If they are looking for a journal enrty they might enter a keyword or a date and time. 

### Operation (semantics)

_What might happen when a program runs? How does a program interact with the
user? What kinds of errors might occur, and how might they be communicated to
the user?_

When a journal entry is submitted it is automatically categorized by date and time submitted and stored within the user's system. If they are searching for an entry it can be printed from within the language or will open a txt file if they want to edit. 

### Expressiveness

_What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but
difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?_

It should be easy to organize text files and read and create them, but it should be difficult to save data that is not text. It should be imposible to use this for anything other than journaling or organizing texts. 

### Related work

_Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there
aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well
do they address the need? Are there any particularly admirable qualities of the
language? Are there parts of the language you think could be improved?_

Surprisingly I could not find any DSLs made for journaling, although there countless applications that could be used for journaling. These are all either overcomplicated, unsecure, or unorganized. I don't know for sure that there aren't any DSLs made to do this, but after searching for one on multiple search engines and not finding any I can conclude that even if there is one it is not accessible for people to find. I think this is because journaling is simple and people don't really think of needing to program a journal. 

## The Project

This section examines whether the idea makes for a good CS 111 project.

I think it would make a good project because it is relatively simple but there are a lot of things you could do with it. 

### Suitability

_If someone were to work on this project, what percentage of their time would be
spent directly engaging in the **language** aspects of this project (e.g.,
making language design decisions), as opposed to "systems" aspects of the
project (e.g., implementing a complicated semantics that doesn't require a lot
of language design)?_

I think that about 75% of the time would be spent on the systems since this language would be more focused on performance than accessibility. 

### Scope

_How big an idea is this? How ambitious is this project?_

This project wouldn't be very ambitious but there are a lot of cool features you could add to make it better. 

### Benefits and drawbacks

_Why might this be a good idea for a project? Why might this not be a good idea
project?_

I think that this could be a good idea because it would be somewhat usefull to save time organizing, but at the same time it is not very hard to just organize a journal without a language so I don't know if it would be worth the time designing it.
